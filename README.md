# PexWrapper
Translates PermissionsEx Style commands to LuckPerms style commands. Covers everything here https://luckperms.net/wiki/GM-&-PEX-Command-Equivalents expect for `pex import`

## Quirks
- Sets all lp priorities to 999999
- Does not allow multi worded permission nodes (although I've never seen one in the wild)
- No help if you get the command wrong, pex doesn't help you either.
